# My First Django Project

Welcome to my first Django project! This project is part of my journey to learn how to create and manage a Django application.
This project was created as part of the #100DaysOfDjango challenge. The primary goal is to understand the basics of setting up a Django project and to get hands-on experience with the Django framework.
