# 100DaysOfDjango

Welcome to the **100DaysOfDjango** repository! This repository is created to contain my Django projects and exercises I complete during my 100-day challenge. Additionally, I will also store some React projects here.


This repository is part of my commitment to learning and mastering Django over a period of 100 days. Throughout this journey, I will be building various projects and completing exercises to enhance my skills. I will also be working on some React projects to complement my learning.

I embarked on this 100-day challenge not only to gain proficiency in Django but also to prepare for implementing my final year project at Infolink University College. This repository will serve as a comprehensive collection of my learning journey, showcasing my progress and the projects I develop along the way.
